# Hidden Files

Hidden Files is a shell script that spread fragments of a file into a disk without notifying the file manager of the disk. Thus,
the file jus can be read through the script. 

- To read: ./hiddenFiles.sh -r \<disk\>
- To write: ./hiddenFiles.sh -w \<file\> \<disk\>
- the script must be run with sudo permission.
